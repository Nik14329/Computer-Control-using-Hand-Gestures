# Computer-Control-using-Hand-Gestures
## Hand Gestures Controlled Computer using Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Python GUI

This project enables users to control their computer using hand gestures, employing Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI). By detecting and interpreting hand movements, users can perform various actions without the need for physical interaction with the computer peripherals.

### Features:
- Utilizes Arduino to interface with the ultrasonic sensor and capture real-time hand gestures.
- Implements a Python GUI to receive and process data from the Arduino, enabling user-friendly interaction.
- Detects hand gestures, such as swipes, taps, and circles, to trigger specific computer actions.
- Allows users to control cursor movement, left-click, right-click, scroll, and more using intuitive hand gestures.
- Offers customization options for mapping gestures to specific actions, tailoring the interaction to individual preferences.
- Provides visual feedback on the GUI to enhance user experience and assist in gesture recognition.

### Hardware Setup:
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB for data transmission.

### Software Setup:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the project's documentation.
3. Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible software.
4. Run the Python script or launch the GUI application to start the hand gesture recognition system.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the system and perform different actions using hand gestures.

### Usage:
- Use swiping gestures to move the cursor across the screen.
- Perform a tap gesture to simulate a left-click action.
- Perform a two-finger tap gesture to trigger a right-click action.
- Perform circular gestures to simulate scrolling up or down.
- Customize the mapping of gestures to specific actions as desired.

### Results:
The Hand Gestures Controlled Computer project offers a unique and intuitive way to interact with computers, reducing the reliance on traditional input devices. By providing an alternative input method through hand gestures, it enhances accessibility and user experience. The project demonstrates the potential of combining Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and Python GUI to create innovative and user-friendly computer control systems.
